# Advanced Locomotion System Refactored

Completely reworked and improved ะก++ version of [Advanced Locomotion System V4](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-locomotion-system-v1).

The main goal of this ALS version is a complete and high-quality refactoring of all aspects of the plugin to make it easier to understand, flexible, reliable (especially in network multiplayer), performant, and simply more enjoyable to work with.

<details>

<summary><b>Features</b></summary>

- Reworked plugin structure. Content is separated into 3 categories: `ALS` - main content, `ALSCamera` - camera-related content, and `ALSExtras` - other optional content
- Use of multiple linked animation blueprints instead of a single monolithic animation blueprint.
- Use of animation layer interfaces to dynamically switch overlay states at runtime instead of directly referencing them in animation blueprints.
- Use of the **Control Rig** plugin for IK and other bone manipulation tasks instead of animation graph nodes.
- Significantly reduced the number of virtual bones required by the plugin.
- Added the ability to disable the use of IK bones and use only virtual bones for all bone manipulation tasks, which can be useful in cases where IK bones are not animated in your custom animations.
- Added a skeleton asset action that can help set up all the necessary skeleton stuff: animation curves, slots, virtual bones, etc. It can be accessed by right-clicking on the skeleton asset -> Scripted Asset Actions -> Setup Als Skeleton.
- Reworked foot locking to make it more performant and reliable, especially in network multiplayer.
- Reworked foot and pelvis offset logic for smoother movement of the character on stairs and sloped surfaces.
- Added `Slot` overlay animation curves to control the blending of overlay poses with animation montages played in `Layering` animation slots.
- Added `Blend Curves` and `Blend Poses by Gameplay Tag` animation graph nodes. `Blend Curves` blends animation curves without the need for the `VB curves` virtual bone, and `Blend Poses by Gameplay Tag` is similar to `Blend Poses by Enum` but uses gameplay tags instead of enum.
- Moved thread-safe animation instance logic to the worker thread to improve game thread performance.
- Added automatic generation of foot sync markers using `B_Als_AnimationModifier_FootSyncMarkers`.
- Replaced C++ enums such as `EAlsOverlayMode` with gameplay tags, allowing new entries to be added without code modification.
- Reworked `UAlsCharacterMovementComponent` for better movement synchronization over the network.
- Added support for direction-dependent movement speed.
- Reworked mantling. Implemented as root motion source for better movement synchronization over the network.
- Reworked camera. Implemented as a component similar to the standard camera component, no need for custom `APlayerCameraManager` or `APlayerController` classes.
- Reworked debug mode. Toggled by pressing `Shift + [1-8]` or using console commands such as `ShowDebug ALS.Curves`.
- Use of **Push Model** and support of **Iris** replication system.
- Use of the **MetaSounds** and **Enhanced Input** plugins.
- Support of **Update Rate Optimization** (disabled by default) and **Large World Coordinates**.
- A lot of other fixes, improvements and refactorings.
